## Design Goals

Goals that were taken into consideration when developing Hazelchain, were that we wanted this to be a simple to use and
easy to understand cryptocurrency.

To distribute coins as well as reduce Hazelchain's carbon footprint, hazelchain was developed to be able to switch
between 2 concensus algorithms, both [proof of work](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proof-work.asp)
and [proof of stake](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proof-stake-pos.asp)

## Running

###### This tutorial is for the [CLion IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/) and should be compatible with the [Intellij family of IDEs](https://www.jetbrains.com/products/#level=ide) by Jetbrains, but it may work differently if you are using something else.

1. download the [zip](https://github.com/Shadow2ube/Hazelchain/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) or clone the repository.
2. extract the contents to an empty folder.
3.
    - If you're using linux or macOS, continue to step 4.
    - If you're using Windows:
        1. Download The [Windows subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/). WSL version
           2 may work but version 1 is easier to set up

        2. Download a version of linux from the Windows store (we
           recommend [Ubuntu](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/ubuntu/9nblggh4msv6), but any distribution should work).
        3. Set WSL as
           the [default](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/clion/how-to-use-wsl-development-environment-in-product.html)
           development environment.
4. Run the project as any other project in your IDE.
