## Design Goals

Goals that were taken into consideration when developing Hazelchain, were that we wanted this to be a simple to use and easy to understand cryptocurrency. Other goals was that we also wanted was for it to have as many important features as possible before its launch, as well as have it capable of getting more features easily.

Hazelchain is a cryptocurrency built to be light and minimize its environmental footprint by initially using a [proof of work](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proof-work.asp) algorithm to initially distribute coins, then later switching to using a [proof of stake](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proof-stake-pos.asp) consensus algorithm to make collecting coins more fair.

## Running
###### This tutorial is for the [CLion IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/) and should be compatible with the [Intellij family of IDEs](https://www.jetbrains.com/products/#type=ide) by Jetbrains, but it may work differently if you are using something else.

1. download the [zip](https://github.com/Shadow2ube/Hazelchain/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) or clone the repository.
2. extract the contents to an empty folder.
3.
    - If you're using linux or macOS, continue to step 4.
    - If you're using Windows:
        1. Download The [Windows subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/).
        2. Download a version of linux from the Windows store (we recommend [Ubuntu](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/ubuntu/9nblggh4msv6), but any distribution should work).
        3. Set WSL as the [default](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/clion/how-to-use-wsl-development-environment-in-product.html) development environment.
4. Run the project as any other project in your IDE.
