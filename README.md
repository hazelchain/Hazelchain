## Design Goals

Goals that were taken into consideration when developing Hazelchain, were that we wanted this to be a simple to use and easy to understand cryptocurrency. Other goals was that we also wanted was for it to have as many important features as possible before its launch, as well as have it capable of getting more features easily.

Hazelchain is a cryptocurrency built to be light and minimize its environmental footprint by using a [proof of stake](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proof-stake-pos.asp) consensus algorithm instead of the traditional mining algorithm.
